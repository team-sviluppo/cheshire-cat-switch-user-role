# What is this?
This is a plugin (tool) for the [Cheshire Cat Project](https://github.com/pieroit/cheshire-cat), allowing to change the default Agent behavior (the Cheshire Cat from Alice's adventures in wonderland) and reset the episodic memory. This plugin is useful when you want to give specific context to the Language Model.

The cat will give a feedback after a command:

eg
Human : "Change your role in php developer"
Cat : "Now i acting like php developer"

Human : "Reset your memory"
Cat : "Memory resetted"
